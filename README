A README file for my first serious iOS project.
It is yet another science calculator.

## Log
2012-02-26 Start coding the UI.
2012-02-27 Create a git repository.
2012-02-28 Draw button images.
    For some devices, default fonts may be replaced.
    So I may have to use images for all buttons.
2012-02-29 Layout buttons.
    Still some button images to draw.
    Move images to a single directory.
2012-03-02 Draw button images and add screen.
    Button images have to be cached.
    I will make a cache for them.
2012-03-04 Add image-pool for buttons.
    Use tag for buttons.
    Add LED indicators.
    I don't like the indicators.
